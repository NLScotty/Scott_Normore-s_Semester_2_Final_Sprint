This is my submission for the personal component of the final sprint.

I tried a few designs on figma, but initially none of them looked promising.
By happenstance, I came across a w3 tutorial on collapsible sections, and played around
in figma with components that mirrored the look of them, and came up with this page as a result. I'm quite
proud of the end result, and I have the static page hosted on github pages here:

I really like this end result due to how easy it will be to expand upon once I have
more stuff to show off. I also like how clean and professional it ended up looking; I'm
probably actually going to use this page to show off my resume/cv.

As a side note, this was a great idea for a final project for the sprint, and I happy
that I got to make something that I'm going to use in the future!
